### All OOP Lab questions!
---  

PDFs are generated from markdown using pandoc. The Markdown files themselves are generated from a [template](template.md) using a [script](https://github.com/crestfalln/assignment-md-maker) I wrote.  
For md-files of assignments given in group go [here](https://github.com/crestfalln/LabOOP/tree/master/Assign(From%20Group)).  
Assignment given in gc is still in progress so no md-files for now.
